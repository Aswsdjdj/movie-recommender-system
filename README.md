# movie-recommender-system
A movie recommender system is a specialized software application that suggests movies to users based on various inputs such as previous viewing history, ratings given by the user, and other contextual information. It utilizes algorithms, often leveraging machine learning or data mining techniques, to analyze patterns and preferences in a user's behavior or similarities among movies (e.g., genre, actors

, director, etc.). By processing this information, the system can predict and recommend movies that the user is likely to enjoy. Examples of such systems can be seen in platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu, which aim to enhance user experience by providing tailored movie suggestions.
